# Smart Contract with Truffle Framework

This repository contains a Solidity smart contract project built using the **Truffle framework**. Truffle is a development environment, testing framework, and asset pipeline for Ethereum, designed to make smart contract development easier.

## Features:
- **Smart Contract Development**: Written in Solidity, the smart contract handles [describe contract functionality, e.g., token transfers, voting system, etc.].
- **Truffle Framework**: Truffle is used for compiling, migrating, and managing smart contracts.
- **Ganache**: For local blockchain testing, Ganache CLI is used to simulate a blockchain network.
- **Testing**: Includes JavaScript test scripts for contract functionality validation.
- **Deployment**: Contracts are configured for deployment on a local Ganache instance and can be extended to test networks.

## Getting Started:
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   
2. Compile contracts:
   ```bash
   truffle compile
   ```

3. Migrate contracts:
   ```bash
   truffle migrate
   ```
